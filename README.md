**API Testing Framework**
This API Testing Framework is built using Java and RestAssured, which is a popular library for testing RESTful APIs. It is a data-driven testing framework, which means that test data is fetched from an external source, in this case, an Excel spreadsheet. The framework is designed as a data-driven testing framework, meaning that test data is stored in an external data source such as an Excel file, and the framework reads the data from the file during test execution. This allows for easy maintenance and updates to test data without requiring changes to the actual test code. The framework includes an implementation of the Logger, which is used to log details during the execution of tests. This feature helps in debugging and identifying issues during the testing phase. The Logger can be customized based on the user's requirements and can be used to output logs to different sources such as the console, log files, or database. For reporting purposes, the framework uses Extent Reports, which is a powerful reporting library that generates HTML reports. These reports include information about the tests that were run, their status, and other details such as the time taken to execute the tests. The reports can be easily shared with other team members and stakeholders to keep them informed about the testing progress and results. Overall, this API Testing Framework provides a comprehensive solution for testing RESTful APIs. Its data-driven approach allows for greater flexibility in testing different scenarios and its use of Extent Reports and Logger ensures that test results are well-documented and easily accessible and customizable. Also I have wrapped with BDD cucumber framework utilities to make even understandable in a quick manner.
